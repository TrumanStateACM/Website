# Upcoming: 

## General Meeting October 15<sup>th</sup> 

Threading in Python: we'll start simple with basic concurrency, and then talk about cross-thread communication techniques. Next we'll discuss how Python internally operates, and how this impacts design decisions. Finally, we'll end with a quick discussion of asyncio, a recent and novel addition to Python's concurrency libraries.
As always, if there is something specific you want to see don't hesitate to contact us at acm@truman.edu
