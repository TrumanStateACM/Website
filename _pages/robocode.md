# Robocode is here, 10<sup>th</sup> of November 

### Pre-register [here][prereg] (This is not a commitment, we just want to get an idea of how many will be there)

We are happy to announce a new event we are hosting called Robocode. Get ready to program your own personal robot and destroy your competition, in a friendly manner of course. 

We will be holding an informational meeting about Robocode on the 5<sup>th</sup>. This will technically be part of the event, but a fee will not be charged until we meet on the 10<sup>th</sup> for the actual battling of the robots. Remember you dont need much experience at all to compete. 

If you want to get a head start you can download the program [here][robocode]

### Rules
- Teams of 1-4
- Two tiers beginner and regular
	- Prizes for each
- Try not to copy and paste peeoples robots. You should mostly understand the code that you add to the robot

### Helpful Links
- [Robocode CS project][RCP]. This is from another school, but could help get through some basics. 
- [Robocode API Documentation][api]
- [Tutorials][AT]. These direct to archived pages, not all links work. This is very good for understanding events and what all events come with robocode
- [Robowiki][RW]. This one is probably self explanitory
