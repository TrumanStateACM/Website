# Start getting your robots ready for next years Robocode

Remember you don't need much experience to make a robot. Start checking out links and tutorials and you will be ready to battle in no time.  

If you want to get a head start you can download the program [here][robocode]

### Rules
- Teams of 1-4
- Two tiers beginner and regular
- Try not to copy and paste peoples robots. You should mostly understand the code that you add to the robot
- Create your robot before the competition
- submit robot as a jar file

### Helpful Links
- [Robocode CS project][RCP]. This is from another school, but could help get through some basics. 
- [Robocode API Documentation][api]
- [Tutorials][AT]. These direct to archived pages, not all links work. This is very good for understanding events and what all events come with robocode
- [Robowiki][RW]. This one is probably self explanatory
- [Meeting minutes][MM] for the info meeting
