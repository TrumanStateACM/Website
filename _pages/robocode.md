# Robocode is here, 10<sup>th</sup> of November. 12pm in VH 1236 

### Pre-register [here][prereg] (This is not a commitment, we just want to get an idea of how many will be there)

We are happy to announce a new event we are hosting called Robocode. Get ready to program your own personal robot and destroy your competition, in a friendly manner of course. 

Make sure to create your robot before arriving at the event as there will be no time given at the event to create it. Remember you dont need much experience at all to compete. 

If you want to get a head start you can download the program [here][robocode]

### Rules
- Teams of 1-4
- Two tiers beginner and regular
	- Prizes for each
- Try not to copy and paste peeoples robots. You should mostly understand the code that you add to the robot
- Create your robot before the competition

### Helpful Links
- [Robocode CS project][RCP]. This is from another school, but could help get through some basics. 
- [Robocode API Documentation][api]
- [Tutorials][AT]. These direct to archived pages, not all links work. This is very good for understanding events and what all events come with robocode
- [Robowiki][RW]. This one is probably self explanitory
- [Meeting minutes][MM] for the info meeting
