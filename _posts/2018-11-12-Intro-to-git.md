[Here][GN] is where you can find all the notes on git, thanks to Dr. Bindner

- Git is a collaborative tool
    - it allows multiple people work on a project and not worry that you will mess up your project
    - If you or a partner messes up, you can go back to a working version of it
- Git is also useful for personal projects
    - it allows you to track what you have done
    - allows you to try things without worrying about breaking your project
