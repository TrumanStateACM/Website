Professors teaching important classes 
- CS 181 - Beck, Jaiswal
- CS 191 - Halma
- CS 250 - Matthews
- CS 260 - Matthews
- CS 291 - Garvey
- CS 330 - Matthews
- CS 430 - Jaiswal
- CS 460 - Neitzke
- CS 470 - Jaiswal
- CS 480 - Garvey

Notes: 
- This is one of the first times neither Halma or Neitzke is teaching 291. I would take that if at all possible
- Neitzke has also started teaching 330 recently. If you are able to i would also take 330 with Matthews
- I personally think it would be really fun to take 181 with Beck, but I think you would get just as much out of it with Jaiswal

<br />

Secondary courses offered in science and math
- Stat 290 - Thatcher
- Calc 1 - Vazzana, Howard, Palumbo
- Calc 2 - quinn, fernando
- Calc 3 - Belanger
- Math 200 - Easley
- Phys 185 - Ling, Sherafati
- Chem 100 - Carter, Afzal, Kauffmann
- Chem 130 - Kauffmann, Fuller, Lyon
- Biol 100 - Bergey, Berke, Kuczynski, Ma, Pareja
- Biol 106 - Fielden-Rechav

Notes:
- Thatcher is probably the easiest stat teacher. She also teaches it almost every semester. If you cant take it with her, try and get Downey if available
- Vazzana is an amazing calc professor. if possible take any calc class with him
    - Garth is also a professor who teaches calc. You may not learn as much with him, but his classes tend to be easy
- Math 200 replaces 191. You will learn more with Easley, but Garth teaches it sometimes and is easier
- Carter is great for chem 100 if you dont want to learn anything
- Ma is a chill professor, but may not be good for beginning classes
    - Bergey and Fielden are great professors
    - Avoid Berke 

<br />

LSP classes
- there are a lot of these classes with many professors for each one
- use [Rate My Professors][RMP] and look them up to see which are good
- Professors can make an easy class hard, so look them up

<br />

Some specific reqirements
- Philosophy and religion
    - Logic (really good for learning proofs)
    - Ethics (easy, but can be boring since you already have to take an ethics class)
    - Exploring religions (easy)
- Health 
    - Military science (2 sem) More of a time commitment
    - Lifetime fitness
    - Personal health and fitness
    - one of the fitness classes is partially online

- Chem 100 (4 Credit) - Don't learn much
- PD 312 Basic Aviation (3 Credit) 
- Ask upperclassmen

<br />

Jins
- ask around
