## Topic: resumes 

Contact info
- Keep it short and simple 
    - Name 
    - Email
    - Phone number
    - Links to sites
    - Address (according to the career center companies often sort by how close a candidate is to the place they will work)



Summary/Objective
- Tell the recruiter what you want to do with your skills, not what the skills specifically are
- Show ambition and the drive to utilize what you know
- Keep it short (Jaiswal emphasized this because some recruiters do not like it when this is included)


Experience 
- Think big 
    - Of course you programmed at a CS internship
    - think more of specifically what you did
- Freshman
    - They know you haven't done real work in CS yet so keep this short. Focus on projects
- Think of what skills you used hard or soft and the combination of both
    - Programmed an android app as a team 
- Never say you have no experience. If you donâ€™t you have the power to change that
    - There are countless websites out there that allow you to practice 
    - [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
    - [Code Academy](https://www.codeacademy.com)

Education
- This can add to experience if you don't have a lot. 
- Specify coursework that will stand out
- Specify awards or honors
- Anything else you did in school that could pertain

Skills
- You want to know how to talk about your skills
- Expand upon the skill with tools you use for it
    - Database software
    - Development environments
- Try to keep them relevant or related to what you do
    - You're not good at writing papers, your a strong technical writer
