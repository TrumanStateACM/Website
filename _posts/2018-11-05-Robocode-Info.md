### Robocode

<!--more-->

About
- Program robots in java

Installation
- Must have java virtual machine installed
- Download from website 
- Pretty simple

Run test battles 
- Battle -> new

Creating your robot
- Robot menu, then select Source Editor.
- When the editor window comes up, click on the File menu, then select New Robot.

Not going to go through the specifics of how to create a whole robot. There are lots of resources out there
- Tutorials
- Api documentation
- some on robocode page our acm website

A lot of the development of a robot is the implemetation of event handlers
- If you dont know what these are dont worry, you can use the ones that already come with it or just look up how the others work. 
- events basically interrupt the flow of the program
	- this can be things such as seeing a robot which makes you want to fire at it
- You can also look at other robots and see how they are set up. This does not mean copy from them.  

Submitting your robot
- Create it and save when done
- Exit the editor and select robot
- Select package robot or team

Scoring
- Scoring is based on many things
	- How many died before you
	- How many times you hit someone
	- So just living is not good enough

Two tries per division
- We will run your bots, most likely all at once against eachother 
- then take an hour break to revise and edit the bots if you choose.
-  Then run them against each other again. 

Each try has a set amount of rounds rounds inside it
