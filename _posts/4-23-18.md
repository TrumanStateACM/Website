   - Simply signing messages saying you are paying someone doesn't work
      - You can sign a message to multiple people
   - There must be a way for everyone to know when a payment is made
      - Blockchain is a way to go
 
- Blockchain
   - When you make a transaction, you set an amount of money you will pay someone if they find a block in the chain
      - You want the money or fee to be high enough that miners will want to include it in their blocks
   -  It takes lots of time and money to mine these blocks  
      - This makes it far to expensive to forge blocks
      - After a few blocks, a transaction is cemented into the block chain
   
- Why care about digital currency
   - Don't really care as much in US because we have credit cards and similar devices 
   - It is very expensive and difficult to get money in and out of the US
      - Digital currency can make this cheaper
   - In unstable countries, it is easy to smuggle digital currency out by remembering a set of words or a passcode for a digital wallet
