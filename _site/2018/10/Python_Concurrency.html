<p>python basics</p>

<ul>
  <li>uses white space instead of brackets</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">stuff</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Concurrency</p>

<ul>
  <li>used to programs that execute on one thread that runs from start to finish and you can trace it</li>
  <li>concurrency allows multiple tasks to be preformed at once</li>
  <li>have to wait for threads to finish before we exit the main program
    <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>this all allows for more work to be done in less time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Python has some oddities</p>
<ul>
  <li>to pass in arguments you have to make it known you are passing in tuples not other data types
    <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span> \\<span class="nb">int</span>
<span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,)</span> \\<span class="nb">tuple</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Threading in Python specifically</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using the basic threading package in python, all threads are run on the same python thread.
    <ul>
      <li>this means that three threads in your program are running on the one thread on your computer</li>
      <li>this ends up making threading run slower in many scenarios</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the operating system gives the python interpreter a single core and then the python interpreter has to schedule the three threads on its own which can lead to it taking longer than linear execution</li>
  <li>what is the use of threading if it slows down the program</li>
</ul>

<p>Blocking and non-blocking</p>

<ul>
  <li>blocking is basically something that requires the program or thread to wait for something
    <ul>
      <li>such as sleeping or waiting for network traffic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Sharing memory</p>
<ul>
  <li>when you have shared memory, multiple threads have access to the same data</li>
  <li>when the scheduler doesn’t overlap execution of the threads, you can get the right answer
    <ul>
      <li>other times you cannot</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>an example is adding and subtracting at the same time in two different times
    <ul>
      <li>one run got 0, the desired answer</li>
      <li>the second run got -30549</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>we often do not want memory accessed at the same time</li>
</ul>

<p>Semaphore</p>
<ul>
  <li>how do you make sure data isn’t edited concurrently</li>
  <li>you often use locks
```
self.lock = threading.lock</li>
</ul>

<p>s.lock.aquire()
stuff
s.lock.release()</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
- this allows for a thread to deny access to memory while it executes
- for logic that requires constant locking of data, this can make threading slower than linear due to overhead 

This doesnt sound good. when would you use threads
- think of accessing a first in first out queue and producer and consumer example(you can google this if you dont know what that is)
    - the threads should not be looking at the same part of the queue very often
    - this means, there shouldnt be many times when one thread is locked out of the queue making it much faster to thread it
- so try to group and minimize the code using the memory
- if you have a lot of blocking code this is also good

Daemon threads
- normal threads will keep running after the main thread or main program has ended
- a Daemon thread will stop running the second the main thread exits
    - even if its not finished, the thread will close
    - this is dangerous if say the thread is accessing the file

Multiprocessing
- This is actually using multiple processors on the computer
- this allows for true actual concurrency
- python is no longer using a scheduler

In python threading is different than multiprocessing
- threading is using one hardware thread while multiprocessing is using multiple hardware threads
- the python interpreter can only ever run one thread. it is a single threaded processor regardless
    - to do true multiprocessing, python will open a new interpreter for each processes in your program
    - a pipe is then created to pass your program to the new interpreter
        - this can lead to slow downs if your program requires large parameters to be passed
    - this copying of your program allows a small window a python interpreter is running without your code
    - it is possible for a malicious program to insert code into this interpreter and run it using the permission of your parent program
        - if your program is running in sudo, malicious code can get sudo access
    - this is fixed by using cryptographic handshakes to make sure your code is running and not malicious code

Asyncio
- scheduler only knows if a thread is blocked or not blocked
    - this can lead to some overhead of polling the threads 
- async allows for threads to declare when they are no longer blocking kind of
```python
async def name():
    code to run

<ul>
  <li>allows threading without as much overhead</li>
  <li>similar thing is there in node.js
    <ul>
      <li>kind of where it comes from</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
